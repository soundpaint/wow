  User account info is stored in the database that backs the system.
  It is managed by some user (typically, the "admin" user)
  that has access to the pages and functions for managing roles.
  For bootstrapping purposes, i.e. when starting with an
  empty database, there is not yet any user for managing roles.
  Therefore, this configuration file defines a minimal set
  of users (usually, just the "admin" user and a guest user for
  the process of login).

    <!-- Run the java tool org.poly.security.MD5Hash to compute the
         hexadecimal representation of a MD5 hash for a given
         password.

         N.B.: Be careful not to include a trailing new line character
         "\n" when creating the MD5 hash, as the additional character
         results in a completely different hash value.  To avoid any
         trailing new line character, you may use the following
         command in most unix shells:
         
           echo -n "my-password" | md5sum
