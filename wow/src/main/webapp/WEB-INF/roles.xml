  User roles are stored in the database that backs the system.
  They are managed with some role (typically, the "admin" role)
  that has access to the pages and functions for managing roles.
  For bootstrapping purposes, i.e. when starting with an
  empty database, there is not yet any role for managing roles.
  Therefore, this configuration file defines a minimal set
  of roles (usually, just the "admin" role and a guest role for
  the process of login).
