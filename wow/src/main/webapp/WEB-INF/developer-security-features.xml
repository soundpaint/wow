  <!-- PRIVILEGES - - - A privilege is the atomic unit of operation
       right management from the developer's point of view.  It refers
       to a specific database table, but does not distinguish between
       specific records within that table.  It is strongly recommended
       for a web project to reference a privilege at most once and
       only on a single web page.  Otherwise, the XHTML-to-Java
       compiler will emit a warning (TODO) for the following reason.
       If a customer thinks that there is no difference between two or
       more of these privileges (e.g. updating and deleting some data
       record of specific table), you - as a developer - still should
       use different atomic privileges, but join them to a single
       privilege set as desired by the customer (see the
       "privilege-sets.xml" configuration file).  This way, if a
       different customer feels that a different set of the
       develeoper's point of view privileges forms a single customer
       point of view privilege, you simply may create a different
       privilege set that satisfies that customer.
